# CHATSystem_PHP

This repository contains my freelance Chat System code in PHP<br>
<strong>I have used Bootstrap and CSS3 to implement CHAT SYSTEM</strong><br>
Basically I have segregated my code into different files.<br>
For eg: DBconnect.php contains only my Database Connection.<br>
This way I have tried to keep my code separeate which can be easy and handy to use.<br>
